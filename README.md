### Hello there üëã

A little bit about myself. I am a committed and young software developer who has gathered a profound base of theoretical software design and also applied this knowledge at the technical university of Vienna. Besides working in that field for more than five years now I have also created software for the volunteering work in scouting. I am eager to write useful and user-friendly software, therefore I am challenging myself to new tasks and problems and always stride to educate myself on new topics of software design.

### Current Projects
üçΩÔ∏è A tool for scout groups to handle small events

This project is in it's fifth iteration thus applying a lot of findings and new ideas. It is a full stack web-app wholly written in TypeScript using frameworks like:
- VueJS with Vuetify, Pinia, etc. (Frontend)
- FeathersJS (Backend)

### My experience
Whilst journying the landscape of programming I have stumbled across several languages, frameworks, etc. By now I have learned many things:

Languages I manage to understand and write:
- JavaScript/Typescript
- Java
- C/C++
- HTML (also CSS)
- C# (Basics)

System setup I used:
- CMake
- GCC
- CTest

Frameworks I used:
- VueJS (Vuetify, VueX, Pinia, VueRouter) with both Composition and Options-API
- FeathersJS with Sequelize-ORM
- Express

Databases I filled:
- SQL-Based (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB)

Documentations I have provided with:
- MarkDown
- LATEX
- Doxygen

Technologies I have used:
- Docker (Docker compose)
- Git (Github, Gitlab)
- CloudFoundry

Software I use to manage all the above:
- VS-Code
- Docker-Desktop
- DBeaver
- Commandline (Windows and Linux)
